## Rate Limiting

> **Note**: The current implementation does not enforce rate limiting. In a production environment, you should implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.

## Best Practices

1. Always check the response status code
2. Handle errors gracefully
3. Use appropriate content types for uploads
4. Clean up unused resources
5. Implement proper error handling in your client code
