# RocksDB Clone

A learning-focused implementation of a RocksDB-like key-value store in Rust.

## Overview

This project is an educational implementation of a key-value store inspired by RocksDB. It's designed to help understand the internals of LSM-tree based storage engines.

## Features

- [x] In-memory MemTable with get/put/delete operations
- [x] Write-ahead log (WAL) for durability
- [ ] SSTable storage format
- [ ] Compaction strategies
- [ ] MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)
- [ ] Column families
- [ ] Merge operators

## Current Architecture

```

### Components

- **CLI App**: Command-line interface for user interaction
- **DB Interface**: Main database API (get/put/delete)
- **MemTable**: In-memory key-value store with persistence
- **Write-Ahead Log (WAL)**: Ensures durability by logging all write operations
- **BTreeMap**: Underlying data structure for the MemTable

> Note: The diagram shows the current implementation. Future components (SSTables, compaction, etc.) are not shown.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version recommended)
- Cargo (Rust's package manager)

### Building

```bash
# Build the project
cargo build

# Build in release mode
cargo build --release
```

### Running the CLI

The project includes a simple CLI for interacting with the persistent key-value store:

```bash
# Set a key-value pair (creates or updates the key)
cargo run -- set mykey "my value"

# Get a value by key
cargo run -- get mykey

# Delete a key (marks it as deleted with a tombstone)
cargo run -- delete mykey

# Specify a custom data directory (default is 'rocksdb_data')
cargo run -- --path ./mydata set mykey "my value"
```

### Persistence

The key-value store now includes persistence through a Write-Ahead Log (WAL). All write operations (put/delete) are first written to the WAL before being applied to the MemTable. On restart, the database recovers its state by replaying the WAL.
